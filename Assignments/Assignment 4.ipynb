    "In this assignment we'll look at how to use the functionality of the solve_ivp funciton to extract physically meaningful results. Before we start, one of the things I want you to understand about learnign computational physics is that there is a trade-off between writing things from scratch to learn more, and using established tools to get results fast. In this assignemnet we're leaning more towards the latter. If you'd like to see how we might do the work in this assignment from scratch, send me a message and I can explain it to you.\n",

    "Read the documentation about the \"events\" option. It lets us record the times at which certain events occur. Seems useful right? I'm going to use it to find the range of a projectile. First I'll write some code to simulat e the trajectory of a projectile. This time we will define our vector as $y(t) = \\begin{bmatrix}  Y(t) \\\\  v_Y(t) \\\\  x(t) \\\\ v_x(t) \\end{bmatrix}$ (please don't get confused. The convention for solve_ivp is that the vector is called $y$, so I've decided to label the height of the projectile as $Y$). The deriavative is then  $y'(t) = \\begin{bmatrix}  v_Y(t) \\\\  a_Y(t) \\\\  v_x(t) \\\\ a_x(t) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}  v_Y(t) \\\\ -g \\\\  v_x(t) \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.

    "Now that this is working, I'll write an event function that helps us find the range. Go read the documentation for solve_ivp again, and you see that \"events\" should be a function that with the signature event(t, y), and it should return 0 at the event we want to find (if we want more than 1 type of event (eg range and max height) then we should pass a tuple of functions. It's very easy to write this function, because whent the projective has reached its range, its height is zero. Note that I assign the attribute terminal=True so that the simulation stops once the event is found. I plot the trajectory and also mark the x and y values that were detected by the event. I also compare the calculated range to the theoretical value. As you can see, everyhting is correct."

By simulating a range of initial angles ($\\alpha$), plot a graph of max height against $\\alpha$. The exact formula is $y_{max} = \\frac{v_0^2}{2g} \\sin^2(\\alpha)$, so you can plot that to check your code.\n",
    "2. Copy and modify the pendulum code to produce a plot of period against inital angle $\\theta_0$. Is the period constant, or does it depend on the initial angle? Remember the formula you learned for the period assumes a small initial angle.\n",
    "3. Take your simple harmonic motion code (with no damping) from the last assignment. Add an event that allows you to record the amplitude of oscillations (hint: you just need to find the max/min values of the displacement). Using a single simulation, produce a plot of amplitude as a function of time. Then add damping and see how the plot changes (make sure you keep it underdamped). Try changing the damping and observing how your plot changes. Does it make sense?"
