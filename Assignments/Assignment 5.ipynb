    "In this assignment we will implement a simple monte carlo method to calculate the value of $\\pi$. Obviously we already know the value of $\\pi$, but this exercise serves as a nice demonstation. We will draw a unit square, and draw inside it a quarter-circle with radius $r=1$. We will randomly select many points in the unit square (a random point can be selected by choosing a random number between 0 and 1 for the x value, and another random number between 0 and 1 for the y value).\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the area of the square is $A_sq = 1$, and the area of the semicircle is $A_sc = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ [^1]. Hence the probability of a randomly selected point falling inside the semicircle is $p = \\frac{A_sc}{A_sq} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}{1} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$. Therefore we can find $\\pi$ from this probability: $\\pi = 4p$. On the other hand, in a simulation we can choose many points, and compute the probability $p$ as the empirical probability, $p=\\frac{\\textrm{number of points inside semircle}}{\\textrm{total number of points}}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: (Area of a circle is $A = \\pi r^2$, so area of a quarter-circle is $A = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{4}$. The radius of our quarter-circle is 1)"

    "Once important point about monte-carlo methods. Since we are computing a probability based on random samples, there is an inherent uncertainty - if we used fewer points, then we would be less certain about our calculated value of $\\pi$. Statistics tells us that if we used $N$ points, and calculate a true probability $\\hat{p}$, then there is a 95% chance that the *true* value of $p$ is between  $ p - 1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{p (1 - p)}{N}}$ and  $ p + 1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{p (1 - p)}{N}}$. If you want to understand why, you can read [this page](https://openstax.org/books/introductory-business-statistics/pages/8-3-a-confidence-interval-for-a-population-proportion). It makes sense to say that the uncertainty in the value of $p$ is $\\Delta p = 1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{p (1 - p)}{N}}$. The uncertainty in our value of $\\pi_{\\textrm{calc}}$ is therefore $\\Delta \\pi_{\\textrm{calc}} = 4 \\Delta p$. Let's calculate these and see if our code achieves the expected accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code below and compare the actual error to the theoretical error. For low values of `n_points`, they can be quite different, but when `n_points` is large, they converge. Notice that as you increase `n_points`, the theoretical error decreases. The theoretical estimate of the error allows us to be precise about the error in our calculated values. "

    "1. Adapt my code above to investigate how the calculated value of $\\pi$ varies with the number of points. Make a graph of $\\pi_{\\textrm{calc}}$ against `n_points`. Add to this graph a horizontal line showing the true value of $\\pi$, and also plot $\\pi_{\\textrm{calc}} - \\Delta \\pi_\\textrm{calc}$,  and $\\pi_{\\textrm{calc}} + \\Delta \\pi_\\textrm{calc}$. \n",
    "2. The error function is defined as $\\operatorname{erf(z)} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int^{z}_{0} e^{-t^2} dt$. That is, $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}$ multiplied by the area under the curve $y = e^{-t^2}$ between $t=0$ and $t=z$. This area can be computed using a monte-carlo method. Use such a method to write code to estimate a) $\\operatorname{erf}(1)$, b) $operatorname{erf}(2)$. You can check your answers using [this tool](https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1180573449).\n",

    "*Hint*. First realise that the curve $y=e^-t^2$ has a max value of $1$ at $t=0$ (see graph [here](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot%28e%5E-t%5E2%29). Consider a rectangle with one corner at $(0,0)$ and the opposite corner at $(z, 1)$. That is a rectangle with width $z$ and height 1. This rectangle's area is equal to $z$. Now randomly choose points in this rectange, and check if they fall underneath the curve $y=e^{-t^2}$. In this case, the probability of a point falling under the curve is $p = \\frac{\\textrm{area under the curve } y = e^{-t^2} \\textrm{ between } t=0 \\textrm{ and } t=z}{\\textrm{area of rectangle}} = \\frac{\\int^{z}_{0} e^{-t^2} dt}{z}$, so from the probability, we can calculate $\\int^{z}_{0} e^{-t^2} dt$ and then $\\operatorname{erf}(z)$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extend the code from 2. to create a function that computes $\\operatorname{erf}(z)$ for *any* value of $z$.\n",
    "4. Extend the code from 3. to add a feature to the function that allows the user to specify the *maximum* allowed percentage uncertainty in the calculated value of $\\operatorname{erf}(z)$. (this will involve changing the number of "
