    "solve_ivp has a few more powerful features, such as the \"events\" argument, which we'll look at later. For now, let's turn to solving a system of equations. The [Lotka-Volterra equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations) model the populations of two species, one of which is a predator, and one of which is prey (for example foxes and rabbits). The system of equations is: $\\begin{align} w'(t) &= \\alpha w(t) - \\beta w(t) z(t)  \\\\ z'(t) &= \\delta w(t) z(t) - \\gamma z(t) \\end{align}$, where $w(t)$ is the prey population and $z(t)$ is the predator population. These equations are pretty easy to understand. For example the term $\\alpha z(t)$ represents that the prey species grows at a rate $\\alpha$ in the absence of the predator. The other numbers $\\beta$, $\\delta$ and $\\gamma$ represent things like how often the predators eat the prey. For more details, follow the link.\n",

    "Let's turn to solving a second-order problem. Consider and object which is thrown straight up into the air from ground level with an intial velocity of $v_0$. Writing the height of the object at a time $t$ as $Y(t)$ and neglecting air resistance, we can see that the differential equation governing the object's motion is $Y''(t) = -g$, since it experiences a constant downwards acceleration of $g$, and the initial conditions are $Y'(0) = v_0$ and $Y(0) = 0$. This is a second-order DE, which solve_ivp cannot solve. Instead we must rewrite it as a system of first-order DEs. This sounds confusing, but it's actually very easy. We do it as follows. Define the vector (array) $y(t)$ as $y(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} y_1(t) \\\\ y_2(t) \\end{bmatrix}= \\begin{bmatrix} Y(t) \\\\ Y'(t) \\end{bmatrix}$. Then we will have $y'(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} y_1'(t) \\\\ y_2'(t) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} Y'(t) \\\\ Y''(t) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} Y'(t) \\\\ -g \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} y_2(t) \\\\ -g \\end{bmatrix}$\n",

For simplicity, you may use the initial conditions $x(0) = 1$ and $x'(0) = 0$, and set $\\omega = 2\\pi$. You already know from your classes that the graph of $x$ against $t$ should be sinusoidal with period $T=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$. Does this agree with your computed solution?\n",

Pick a value of $\\gamma$ and solve this equation and plot its solution alongside that of the undamped equation. Experiment with the value of $\\gamma$.

The choice of plus or minus depends on whether the object is moving up down - the drag term should always be in the opposite direction to the velocity, so we can write the equation as $y''(t) = -g - \\operatorname{sign}{(y'(t))}  \\frac{1}{2m} \\rho (y'(t))^2 C_D A$, where $\\operatorname{sign}{(y'(t))}$ simply gives the sign (+ or -) of $y'(t)$. In python you can use `np.sign()`.  You may take mass of object $m=0.5$kg, density of air $\\rho = 1.225$ kg/m^3, drag coefficient $C_D = 0.25$, area $A = 0.019$ m^2, and mass $m=0.4$ kg (these correspond to a soccer ball).\n",

    "    2. *(easiest difficulty)* If the ball is dropped, its velocity will increase, but so will the drag force. Eventually the drag force will be equal to the force of gravity so the velocity will reach a steady value, called the terminal velocity. Solve the equations with appropriate initial conditions to find the terminal velocity. Also write a formula for the terminal velocity and compare your results (if you can't figure out the formula, it's on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity)). *Hint: dopped means the initial velocity is zero, and it doesn't really matter what the initial height is.
